# Senior-Project
The inital plan is to learn how to use machine learning with the game of Starcraft 2. In Starcraft 2 there are three races each with their own units and actions. My plan is to make a bot that can adapt to the other AI opponents tactics and win the match.


## Setup

The ability to do and make bot actions comes from a public repository:
https://github.com/BurnySc2/python-sc2?tab=readme-ov-file  

Sc2 is a free game that can be downloaded on the blizzard website: 
https://starcraft2.blizzard.com/en-us/

Scripts are written in Python 3.9 and above
